# System

**Definition**: The software system used to deliver a product (either directly or indirectly).

**Note**: System, as used in this handbook, is defined recursively. A system can be made up of one or more systems, and it is up to the organization to divide and demarcate system and their various "sub-systems".

**Note**: Systems are often depicted in diagrams using a square.
