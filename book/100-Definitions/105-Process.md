# Process

**Definition**: The sequence of actions standardized by the organization to achieve a specific outcome in supporting or providing a product.

Examples include customer support, traditional product related services (custom work, proposals, etc...)

**Note**: There is frequently confusion between Process and Activity. To avoid confusion, "processes" that occur within the various life cycle phases are defined as Activities, and Process as used in this handbook refers to processes that are used to deliver or support products (see examples above).

**Note**: Process, as used in this handbook, is defined recursively. A process can be made up of one or more processes, and it is up to the organization to divide and demarcate processes and their various "sub-processes".

**Note**: Processes are often depicted in diagrams using a diamond.
