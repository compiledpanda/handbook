# Team

**Definition**: A set of people organized with the intent of achieving a purpose who are responsible for delivering one or more products via creating and maintaining a set of systems and/or processes.

A team can be thought of as the intersection of People, Products, Systems, and Processes all aligned to achieve a singular purpose.

In the beginning of an organization's life there is usually a single team, and the set of People, Products, Systems, and Processes all perfectly overlap into a single united set. As the organization grows, the number of People, Products, Systems, and Processes exceed the ability for a single team to manage, and "sub-teams" are created. These teams are then responsible for a subset of the total set of People, Products, Systems, and Processes within the organization.

Another analogy is a table representing the entire organization, and a number of trays representing teams. Each Person, Product, System, and Process is placed onto a single tray and is assigned to that team.

**Note**: Team, as used in this handbook, is defined recursively. A team can be made up of one or more teams, and it is up to the organization to divide and demarcate teams and their various "sub-teams".
