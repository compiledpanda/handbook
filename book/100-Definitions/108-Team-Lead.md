# Team Lead

**Definition**: The individual that leads a team and is solely responsible for all of the People, Products, Systems, and Processes assigned to that team.

TODO talk about multi-specialty teams and the reality of cross-functional teams in a software product development organization.

**Note**: Being responsible for something does not mean being the one to do the thing. Delegation is real and necessary within a team, and while a person may be responsible for something does not mean that they have to do it or even be capable of doing it. They can rely on trusted specialists within their team to advise, support, and perform work that the team leader cannot or will not (for whatever reason).
