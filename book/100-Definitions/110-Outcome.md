# Outcome

**Definition**: The end result (usually a set of artifacts) or Objective of an Activity within a Life Cycle Phase.

In order to keep this handbook relevant to the vast number of life cycle management tools, this handbook focuses on specifying the outcomes of activities independent of the tools or systems that such outcomes would be created and or stored in.
