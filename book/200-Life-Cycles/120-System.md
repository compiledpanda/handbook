# System Life Cycle

See https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/160/v1/r1/final

**Note**: Do not differentiate between eveolution, development, maintenance, etc... as they all have the same outcomes. The only differences are inputs to the decision to move an item through to implementation in the operation phase (or to not). All other activities and outcomes remain the same.

# Phases & Transitions

TODO: Image of phases & transitions

### Conception
The need for the system is conceived.
### Preparation
Analysis, Design, and implementation of the initial system, up to the point where it is launched.
### Launch
The system is made available to the customer(s) in a "production" setting.
### Operation
The continuous Identification, Planning, Implementation, and Review of items affecting the system.
### Retirement
The system is no longer available to customer(s)
### Disposal
The system is decommissioned and all systems, infrastructure, data, etc... is archived and/or removed.
### Nonexistence
The system no longer exists

# Prior Art

The scope of activities associated with a system, encompassing the system's initiation, development and acquisition, implementation, operation and maintenance, and ultimately its disposal. (https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/system_development_life_cycle#:~:text=Definitions%3A,maintenance%2C%20and%20ultimately%20its%20disposal.)

SDLC is not a methodology per se, but rather a description of the phases that a methodology should address. The list of phases is not definitive, but typically includes planning, analysis, design, build, test, implement, and maintenance/support. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle#:~:text=SDLC%20is%20not%20a%20methodology,implement%2C%20and%20maintenance%2Fsupport.)
