# System Conception
All systems start with conception, where the need for the system is realized. This realization is then encoded into a system charter where high level details are written down and and approved (if needed) prior to beginning pre-launch activities. This charter serves to guide the creation and development of the system over its entire life-cycle, and provides a control hook for approvals to things like system purpose, scope, constraints, etc...

## System Charter
Each system should have a System Charter, which codifies the what, why, and who surrounding this system. Note that this charter should ideally be embedded within or linked to the System 1-Pager (TODO Link). The system charter should contain the following items
### Name
The name of the system, along with any common abbreviations.
### Description
A 1-2 sentence description of the system targeted at a semi-technical. This description should be kept short, high level, and avoid mentioning implementation details.
### Purpose
The purpose that this system serves, and a link to the purpose(s) it supports.
### Owner (Team)
The team that owns this system.
### Scope
A firm but reasonably abstract scope statement containing what this system will and will not do. This should be constructed in a way as to allow the owning team to make modifications and operate the system throughout its lifetime without needing additional approvals as long as they stay within scope.
### Constraints
A set of constraints (practical, functional, budget, etc.) that the system must constrain itself to.
### Data Governance
The set of data stored and processed by the system, paying special attention to Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
### Approvals
A record of any and all approvals (along with the approval date and any related documentation) needed prior to the system beginning pre-launch work. This set of approvals should be specified at the organizational level and should be consistent. For example, a sign-off and approval of the System Charter from a senior leadership team is a good place to start.
### Change Log
A record of changes to the System Charter, with at least the change(s) made and the associated date.

## Transition to Pre-Launch Phase
Once a System Charter has been drafted and approved, the Pre-Launch phase (TODO link) and related activities begin.
