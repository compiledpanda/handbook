# System Pre-Launch
The initial creation, setup, or installation of the system is contained within the Pre-Launch phase, and covers all system development activity up to the Launch transition into the Operational Phase.

<img alt="System Pre-Launch Steps" src="./_img/system-steps.svg" style="max-height:320px" />

The Pre-Launch phase is comprised of 4 distinct steps, Identify, Plan, Implement, and Review. Each of these steps is meant to be completed sequentially for each item that identified, and it is expected that items will be recursively broken down into sub-items, where each sub-item (and its sub-items) will also flow through each of the 4 steps mentioned above. Also note that there is no requirement that a single "meta-item" or "root-item" be identified that all items must be tied to. These 4 steps and the methodology laid out here is intended to add structure and observability to the process, and it is not intended to suggest that this is a fully linear process proceeding once from Identify, Plan, Implement, and Review out through launch and into the Operation Phase.

> This phase should be kept as short as possible. TODO link to / go over reasons why you want to ship quickly and iterate from there.

# Steps and Transitions
What follows is a description of each step and transition, including the major focus' and relevant activities and outcomes for each step, focus, and transition.
