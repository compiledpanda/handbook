# System Pre-Launch
The initial creation, setup, or installation of the system is contained within the Pre-Launch phase, and covers all system development activity up to the Launch transition into the Operational Phase.

> This phase should be kept as short as possible. The goal of each and every item should be to move the system through launch and into operation. TODO link to / go over reasons why you want to ship quickly and iterate from there.

# Activities
Note that the activities here are usually a subset of activities when in operation, with the number of activities generally increasing leading up to launch.
