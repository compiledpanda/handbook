# System Launch

The definition of launch as the point where customers can interact with the system is an important one from the perspective of controls. As there are checks, attestations, and processes that need to be in place before customers can interact with a system, the Launch Transition is an integral step to ensure that all needed and necessary processes, tasks, etc. are complete BEFORE customers are able to use the system. This does not mean that every system needs the same level of preparedness, but that each system should have a launch checklist that has been approved by the proper set of people and has been completed prior to launch (or revised and then completed). This ensures that items such as backups, system security, business continuity, and other processes have have been properly completed before launch to customers.
