TODO: Remove actual descriptions or re-summarize as the descriptions are copyright. (source is 2015 version)
TODO: Map to the activities and outcomes in each Life Cycle
TODO: consider mapping to NIST SP 800-160v1 for security items
TODO: Consider mapping to ISO 12207 as well

## Technical Processes
### Business or Mission Analysis
The purpose of the Business or Mission Analysis process is to define the overall strategic
problem or opportunity, characterize the solution space, and determine potential solution
class(es) that can address a problem or take advantage of an opportunity.
### Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition
The purpose of the Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition process is to define the
stakeholder requirements for a system that can provide the capabilities needed by users and other
stakeholders in a defined environment.
### System Requirements Definition
The purpose of the System Requirements Definition process is to transform the stakeholder, user-
oriented view of desired capabilities into a technical view of a solution that meets the operational
needs of the user.
### System Architecture Definition
The purpose of the System Architecture Definition process is to generate system architecture
alternatives, to select one or more alternative(s) that frame stakeholder concerns and meet system
requirements, and to express this in a set of consistent views and models.
### Design Definition
The purpose of the Design Definition process is to provide sufficient data and information about
the system and its elements to realize the solution in accordance with the system requirements
and architecture.
### System Analysis
The purpose of the System Analysis process is to provide a rigorous basis of information and data
for technical understanding to aid decision-making and technical assessments across the life
cycle.
### Implementation
The purpose of the Implementation process is to realize a specified system element.
### Integration
The purpose of the Integration process is to synthesize a set of system elements into a realized
system that satisfies the system requirements.
### Verification
The purpose of the Verification process is to provide objective evidence that a system, system
element, or artifact fulfills its specified requirements and characteristics.
### Transition
The purpose of the Transition process is to establish a capability for a system to provide services
specified by stakeholder requirements in the operational environment.
### Validation
The purpose of the Validation process is to provide objective evidence that the system, when in
use, fulfills its business or mission objectives and stakeholder requirements, achieving its
intended use in its intended operational environment.
### Operation
The purpose of the Operation process is to use the system to deliver its services.
### Maintenance
The purpose of the Maintenance process is to sustain the capability of the system to provide a
product or service.
### Disposal
The purpose of the Disposal process is to end the existence of a system element or system for a
specified intended use, appropriately handle replaced or retired elements and any waste products,
and properly attend to identified critical disposal needs (e.g., per an agreement, per
organizational policy, or for environmental, legal, safety, or security aspects).

## Technical Management Processes
### Project Planning
The purpose of the Project Planning process is to produce and coordinate effective and workable
plans.
### Project Assessment and Control
The purpose of the Project Assessment and Control process is to assess if the plans are aligned
and feasible; determine the status of the project, technical, and process performance; and direct
execution to help ensure that the performance is within projected budgets according to plans and
schedules to satisfy technical objectives.
### Decision Management
The purpose of the Decision Management process is to provide a structured, analytical
framework for objectively identifying, characterizing, and evaluating a set of alternatives for a
decision at any point in the life cycle and select the most beneficial course of action.
### Risk Management
The purpose of the Risk Management process is to identify, analyze, treat, and monitor the risks
continually.
### Configuration Management
The purpose of the Configuration Management process is to manage system and system
elements and configurations over the life cycle.
### Information Management
The purpose of the Information Management process is to generate, obtain, confirm, transform,
retain, retrieve, disseminate, and dispose of information to designated stakeholders.
### Measurement
The purpose of the Measurement process is to collect, analyze, and report objective data and
information to support effective management and demonstrate the quality of the products,
services, and processes.
### Quality Assurance
The purpose of the Quality Assurance process is to help ensure the effective application of the
organization’s Quality Management process to the project.

## Organizational Project-Enabling Processes
### Life Cycle Model Management
The purpose of the Life Cycle Model Management process is to define, maintain, and help ensure
the availability of policies, life cycle processes, life cycle models, and procedures for use by the
organization with respect to the scope of this International Standard.
### Infrastructure Management
The purpose of the Infrastructure Management process is to provide infrastructure and services
to projects to support organization and project objectives throughout the life cycle.
### Portfolio Management
The purpose of the Portfolio Management process is to initiate and sustain necessary, sufficient,
and suitable projects in order to meet the strategic objectives of the organization.
### Human Resource Management
The purpose of the Human Resource Management process is to provide the organization with
necessary human resources and to maintain their competencies in a manner consistent with
strategic needs.
### Quality Management
The purpose of the Quality Management process is to assure that products, services, and
implementations of the quality management process meet organizational and project quality
objectives and achieve customer satisfaction.
### Knowledge Management
The purpose of the Knowledge Management process is to create the capability and assets that
enable the organization to exploit opportunities to reapply existing knowledge.

## Agreement Processes
### Acquisition
The purpose of the Acquisition process is to obtain a product or service in accordance with the
acquirer’s requirements.
### Supply
The purpose of the Supply process is to provide an acquirer with a product or service that meets
agreed requirements.
