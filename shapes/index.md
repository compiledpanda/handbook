# Shapes
Imagine a team comprised of all the same shape. For example triangles. These triangles do triangle things, and they all embody triangleness to some degree. All of the triangles on the team report to the head triangle. Then imagine another team of squares. These squares all exhbit squareness and do square things. Then imagine that these two teams of shapes work together at a company creating widgets. Each widget needs to be worked on by triangles and squares. First the triangles do their thing on the widgets, and then pass the widgets on to the squares. Sometimes this goes smoothly and the widget got just the right amount of triangleness and quareness appled, but sometimes a widget got a bit too much triangleness (or not enough), and the squares need to pass it back to the triangles to make adjustments (and then the triangles pass it right back). Now imagine that each of these widgets is unique in some way, and not only do the triangles need to vary their level of triangleness that they apply to the widget, but they need to communicate details on the levels of squareness that the widget needs. So they start keeping detailed records for each widget. This works as long as they can fully understand how much squareness each widget needs when they are applying their triangleness. But as the complexity of the widgets grows, and as each widget becomes more unique, the level of planning and back and forth quickly grows and starts to become untennable.

Some bright shape at the company says something like "hey, what if we put triangles and squares on the same team to reduce the problems that arrise trying to pass widgts back and forth between the teams?". So they do. In many ways it works better than before, as triangles and squares working so closely together are able to collaborate closely together and can quickly iterate to provide the right amount of triagnleness and squareness to each widget that passes through. But there are some issues as the company grows and more widgts are produced. We'll come back to the shapes in a bit

* Specialist teams - separate teams of triangles and squares
    * Responsibilities of the team: Who, what, when, where, why, how
    * Leadership: All the same shape, so leadership is fairly straightforward (triangle manager, square manager)
* Cross-Functional teams - teams comprised of triangles and squares
    * Responsibilities: Who, what, when, where, why, how
    * Leadership: Now there is 2 shapes, which shape leads?
        * Pick/Elevate a shape to lead:
            * Can work if the shape understands/works with both shapes (the square has enough triangle to decide and lead/manage)
            * Hard to find shapes that can be multiple shapes
            * Which specific shape leads?
            * What happens when the team starts needing pentagons and hexagons?
            * Can create an overall management structure that silos and works against itself
        * Co-Leaders:
            * Each shape leader is responsible for their shape's w5h
            * Split leadership and dropped responsibility
            * Split management structure
            * No clear position to lead/make calls from which can lead to delays, councils, etc...
* Circle-Led teams:
    * A single circle leads each team
    * Can still be a shape at heart (which is good)
    * Soley responsible for the w5h of the team (but must delegate)
    * All shapes report to a circle (full stop)
    * Advisory shapes
