# Linting
Short and sweet.

1. Pick a linter and linter config, preferably something widely used, and be as close to the default config as possible.
1. Lint locally (via IDE) and require linting to pass on every PR prior to merging

Don't spend a lot of time messing with your linter. You want all of your code to look like it was written by the same person anyway, so your personal proclivities matter much less in the long run anyway. And remember that you are writing code for 2 purposes: 1) to allow a computer to read it and 2) to allow other humans to read it. If the syntax is right you get #1. #2 is what the linter is for.
