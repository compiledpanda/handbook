# Team Lead
This is scoped to a cross-functional team lead position. 

the primary responsibility of the team lead is to lead the team in the execution of the SDLC for items that fall in the product(s) and system(s) that it owns. In essence they are responsible for the people on the team, the product(s) the team owns, and the system(s) the team owns.

### Cross Functional Team
A cross functional team is defined as a team comprised of the specialists necessary to define, build, and support the product(s) and/or system(s) assigned to that team. This typically looks like a mix of product owner/managers, frontend/backend/infrastructure engineers, UX/UI designers, other SMEs, and other individuals based on the needs of the team.

### Team
Every member of a team reports to the Team Lead of that team, regardless of specialty, and Team Leads only report to Team Leads. In effect, this means that every person in the organization reports to a Team Lead on some team, including Team Leads themselves. If teams are to effectively manage themselves, the entire organization must also be arranged in the same format to remove the multi-master problem entirely. This means that there is no "Head/Director/VP of <Specialty>" that exists in the org in terms of reporting with direct reports. That individual exists within a team (usually higher up in the organizational structure), and direction flows downward through the team lead structure. This has the side effect of preventing a "product roadmap" separate from a "engineering roadmap" separate from a "<specialty> initiative roadmap, and properly forces prioritization between these directives at a higher level where it actually belongs (rather than forcing the front-line teams to prompt and force that prioritization).
